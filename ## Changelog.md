### v0.23

I decided that this mod will not significantly change the balance of the game.
All of that will happen in the BTWR Modpack itself.


+ Brought back Wooden & Stone Sword recipes.
+ Restored vanilla mining speeds & durability of all tools.

### v0.22

+ Added Wooden & Bone Club weapons.
+ Added Creeper Oysters Item.
+ Added Diamond Ingot Item.
+ Added Diamond Shears Item.
+ Added Sounds to certain item when they are crafted for extra immersion. :)

+ Changed monsters and animals to no longer take knockback if you aren't using a weapon item. (Club, Sword, Bow, Crossbow && Trident)
+ Changed how creepers work. You can now neuter them by right-clicking on them with Shears.
+ Changed the durability and mining speed of all tools. This makes getting iron tools(& above) much more useful.
+ Changed name of Stick to Shaft.

+ Removed Wooden & Stone Sword.


+ # Release Alpha

+ Initial public release
+ Versions before 0.22 were private testing only.
