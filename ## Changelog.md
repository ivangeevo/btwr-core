## v0.4(dev)
+ The mod is officially in Beta now!
+ Added head drops for certain vanilla mobs and players when killed. Normally this only scales with Looting, but it has compatibility for Better With Time's Battle Axe and also for BWT: Hardcore Tweaks's chopping block killing mechanic
+ Changed the mod versioning scheme to [semver](https://semver.org/).
+ Changed the recipe for diamond plates to yield four plates instead of one to have an incentive to use them instead of normal diamonds
+ Changed how shears are applied as a correct tool to drop leaves blocks internally to allow for other modifications to happen smoother instead of just modifying leaves blocks loot tables
+ Updated the mod to Fabric API 0.116.11, Fabric Loader 0.19.2 & BTWR: Shared Library 0.8.4

## v0.33.5
+ Fixed tanned leather armor pieces having wrong durability values
+ General code cleanup and moved some classes to BTWR: Shared Library
+ Updated the mod to BTWR: Shared Library 0.8

## v0.33.4
+ Updated the mod to BTWR: Shared Library 0.7

## v0.33.3
+ Fixed a bug that would cause the mod to crash when launching the game

## v0.33.2
+ Changed all configuration options in the mod to use the custom config library added by BTWR: Shared Library. This fixes the bug from last version that crashed the game without any warnings of the missing library that created the configurations
+ Removed Supermartijn642's config lib as the one creating configuration setting as it requires itself as a dependency to work properly
+ Updated the mod to BTWR: Shared Library 0.6.5

## v0.33.1
+ Fixed the server configuration options which I tried adding to Mod Menu since the previous update to only be accessible through modifying the config .toml file manually because they weren't working properly. While this might be theoretically possible I'm not sure of the technical details, so changing config options through mod menu for local worlds is not available yet
+ Updated the mod to BTWR: Shared Library 0.6.4

## v0.33
+ Added a new mod tag "NEUTERABLE_CREEPERS" which specifies which creeper entity types can be sheared. Developers can add their custom creepers to this tag to make them shearable.
+ Added a new class "NeuteredCreeperTextures" which allows developers to add sheared texture variants for their custom creeper.
+ Changed/Generally improved Mod Menu configuration option screens to better show how configuration options work
+ Changed all configuration options setting to be handled with Supermartijn642's Config Lib internally instead of Cloth Config API, which is used only for client side config options. Cloth Config is still used for creating all screens for access through Mod Menu.
+ Changed the creeper shearing modification to use Fabric Data Attachments instead of only using mixins.
+ Refactored pretty much the whole code; mainly for readability and cleaning up, but also so it's more in order with other mods from the BTWR project
+ Updated the mod to BTWR: Shared Library 0.63

## v0.32
+ Changed Hearty Stew's class internally, so existing Hearty Stew items might disappear from your worlds
+ Added recipe for crafting Diamond Plate
+ Added recipes for crafting diamond armor with Diamond Ingots and Diamond Plate

+ Updated the mod to Fabric Loader 0.17.3 & BTWR: Shared Library 0.62

## v0.31.4
+ Updated ExtendedShapelessRecipe from BTWR: Shared Library, which fixes some bugs with recipes using it

## v0.31.3
+ Updated mod recipes to use the new ExtendedShapelessRecipe from BTWR: SL v0.60
+ Split mod client side from the main package. Although there weren't any problems before, this is a good practice and the mod should work better in multiplayer
+ Removed old unused assets from the mod files and cleaned up source code a lot
+ Updated the mod to BTWR: Shared Library 0.60

## v0.31.2
+ Removed the remainder logic that damages shears and axes when crafting and moved it to the BTWR: Shared library mod.
+ Updated the mod to Fabric API 0.116.6, Fabric Loader 0.17.2 & BTWR: Shared Library 0.58

## v0.31.1
+ Reverted the hoe modification code from the last update and moved it to an unreleased mod. 
It was causing some issues with other mods that need to be cleaned up before release and
also it's more of a hardcore modification, so I'd like to keep it only in the BTWR modpack.

## v0.31
+ Added a new configurable option that changes how hoes work. Normal usage with right click is removed and players must use the old school way of breaking grass with left click.
+ Added tooltips for all config options when looking at them in Mod Menu
+ Changed creeper explosion to be calculated from their eyes instead feet (also made it toggleable feature via mod menu)
+ Fixed a bug where Hearty Stew & Chicken Soup would not give back an empty bowl item when finished using it if the player inventory is full.
+ Fixed incompatibility with mods that add custom creepers to not get affected by the creeper shearing and ruin their intended experience.
+ Updated the mod to Fabric API 0.116.0, Fabric Loader 0.16.14 & BTWR: Shared Library 0.53

## v0.30.1
+ Fixed a bug with older data files from version 0.29 that were causing issues.
